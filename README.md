# Simon Game

Welcome to the Simon Game project! This web-based game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and replicates the classic Simon memory game. The goal is to repeat the pattern of flashing colors and sounds for as long as you can.

## How to Play

- Start the game by pressing any key on your keyboard.
- Watch and listen as the game displays a sequence of colors and sounds.
- Repeat the sequence by clicking on the buttons in the correct order.
- The game will add one color to the sequence after each successful round.
- Keep playing to see how far you can go!

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Defines the structure of the game interface.

- CSS: Handles the styling of the game, including the visual effects for button presses.

- JavaScript: Responsible for the game's logic and functionality, including generating random sequences and checking user input.

## Game Logic

The game follows these main steps:
1. The game starts when any key is pressed.
2. It displays a sequence of colors and sounds for the player to remember.
3. The player must click the buttons in the correct sequence.
4. If the player's sequence matches the game's sequence, a new color is added to the pattern.
5. The game continues until the player makes a mistake.
6. The player's score is the number of successful rounds completed.

## Features

- **Sound Effects:** The game includes sound effects to make it more engaging.
- **Random Sequences:** The game generates random sequences for the player to mimic, increasing in complexity as the game progresses.
- **Visual Feedback:** Buttons flash and provide visual feedback when pressed.
